## Notes
- I enjoyed trying to design the page to match the NY Best Sellers site.
- There was some confusion when figuring out where to place the glide code to get the image
- Overall not too difficult and I learned and gained experience with APIs and getting data from external sites<!-- Replace this with your specific challenges and experiences -->
